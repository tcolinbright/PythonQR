# QRGen
This repository contains three Python scripts for generating QR codes using the qrcode and PIL libraries:

- ```QRgen_V2.py``` - A simple QR code generator that allows the user to input data and save the generated QR code as a PNG file.


Two different scripts for Generating QR Codes for Wifi. 

- ```Gui_WifiQR.py``` - A QR code generator that allows the user to input the SSID, password, and security type for a WiFi network and saves the generated QR code as a PNG file.

- ```WiFiQR.py``` - A QR generator that requires manual entry, but helpful for batch processing.


Both GUI scripts use the ```tkinter``` library to create a simple GUI interface for the user to input the necessary data, and the ```qrcode``` library to generate the QR code. The ```PIL``` library is used to create and save the generated QR code as a PNG file.

To run either script, simply execute the corresponding Python file from the command line or an IDE such as PyCharm. The user will then be able to input the necessary data and save the generated QR code to a chosen file path.

Feel free to use, modify, and share these scripts as needed.
